Blogz
This is a web app that displays blog posts on a main page and allows users to add new blog posts on a form page. After submitting a new blog entry on the form page, the user is redirected to a page that displays only that blog (rather than returning to the form page or to the main page). Each blog post has a title and a body. 

We will refactor and expand our codebase to make this a multi-user blog site. We'll add authentication, so that users have to log in to create posts. Additionally, users will have their own blogs page, and visitors will be able to view blogs by author, or they can view all blog posts on the site by all authors. And we'll still maintain the ability to view an individual blog entry by itself.
